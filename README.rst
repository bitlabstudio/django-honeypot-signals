Django Admin Honeypot Signals
===============================

If you are using the admin_honeypot App to log failed login attempts, you may want to be notified via email. 

**Features:**

If someone tries to login using the wrong admin url, django-admin-honeypot creates a new model instance, which includes all significant information about this attempt. After save() the signal handler sends a notification email to settings.MANAGERS, which includes the basic model information.

* This app provides a simple signal handler for the App django-admin-honeypot *
https://github.com/dmpayton/django-admin-honeypot

Functions:
If someone tries to login using the wrong admin url, django-admin-honeypot
creates a new model instance, which includes all significant information about
this attempt. After save() the signal handler sends a notification email to
settings.MANAGERS, which includes the basic model information.
